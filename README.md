## About this project
The code of this file has been written as part of the course Nanospintronics at the TUE 

The system at hand consists of a thin nanopillar consisting of a thick "pinned" ferromagnetic layer 
followed by a thin conducting layer and a thin "free" ferromagnetic layer.
The exact stack composition is:

Cu(80nm)/Co(40nm)/Cu(thin)/Co(3nm)/Cu(10nm)

The coordinate system is define by:

## Files and necessities
This project consists of multiple files each with their purpose:
- main.py .... 
- .....py can be run to ....
- .....py constains a series of relevant functions
- .

## important considerations:
- Maybe renormalize H_temp 
- is alpha 0.01?
